When I'm working from home, this 2x3m room is where I do all of my work, including my remote job, freelance projects, and side projects.

This is my current workspace:

One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## Computer

| Name       | Detail                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| OS         | Windows 11 Pro 64-bit                         |
| Proccessor | AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Cores 3.6GHz               |
| RAM        | 32768MB DDR4                                  |
| GPU        | Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Gaming OC Pro 8G |

The specs on this computer might not be top-of-the-line, but it's more than enough to get the job done when it comes to web development.

And just for fun, I actually use this computer to work on React Electron projects and it performs just fine.
