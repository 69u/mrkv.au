I started my career as a systems engineer intern for a local IT company in early 2022, later that year I resigned from my position to focus on completing studies at school and other matters while taking on some freelance projects in my spare time - I've worked with a number of programming languages and tech stack, both Back-end, and Front-end.

Even though the scope of a systems engineer is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Back-End Development**.

## Full-Stack Development

I love creating resources for people that are clean, minimalistic, attractive, that have value and that are easy to use.

I really enjoy creating scripts with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web applications**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- and others.

But I still like to make simple website pages such as **landing pages**.
<br /><br />
So, what tools did I feel comfortable with using during this website creation?

### JavaScript

First of all, the programming language that I'm most knowledagble with using is **JavaScript**, although website creation can be done using PHP, Python, etc.

JavaScript has accompanied me for **about {new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years**.

### Vue JS

I really enjoy building single page application websites and Vue is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2020 ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2020} years)** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Tailwind CSS

For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling.

I'm still new to Tailwind CSS, but **I'm really comfortable** using it and I think it's a great tool.

### Laravel

Laravel is an extremely powerful PHP framework that has allowed me to build elegant applications, over the years I have learned how to use it thoroughly.

### Nuxt.js

Since discovering Nuxt.js, I don't think I would want to use any other web framework. **It's just that good!**
