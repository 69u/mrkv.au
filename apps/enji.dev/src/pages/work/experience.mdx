I started my professional career as a systems engineer intern in early 2022. In late 2022, I resigned from my position to focus on completing college matters while taking on some freelance projects.

## Professional Work

**Inspired IT** (Jan 2022 - Oct 2022)

My first and (currently) only professional work is at Inspired IT. There I was tasked to do many things, such as Office 365 Administration, Windows Server, Remote / On-site IT Support plus much more.

However, my work there was primarily focused on IT support for the clients. 

Here are the details of the work I did for Inspired IT:

- Setup, Deboard and Manage devices & servers using Datto RMM, Backupify and Microsoft's Deployment Toolkit.
- Talked with clients using tickets on Datto AutoTask, communicating a resoloution.
- Managed client orders using Datto Commerce.
- Windows Server (Active Directory, Group Policy, Powershell, MDT).
- Office 365 Administration (Azure Active Directory, Local Active Directory, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, Endpoints).
- Managed Email Signatures at a mass scale using Exclaimer.
- Purchased and managed Office licenses using CSP Portal (A Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider).
- Provided Remote and On-site IT support for clients.
